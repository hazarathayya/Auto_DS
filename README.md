### Adding Automated Processes

If you have implemented any function that automates a specific process within the development of a data science project, we encourage you to contribute it to the repository. Follow these steps to add your automated process:

1. **Check for Existing Folder:**
   - Before adding your function, check if there is a related folder for the process you automated.

2. **Create a Folder (if necessary):**
   - If no folder exists for the process, create one in the appropriate directory.

3. **Add Your Function:**
   - Add your automated function as a Python file within the related folder.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Ensure your function is well-documented, providing clear instructions on how to use it and any dependencies required.

5. **Testing:**
   - If applicable, include test cases to validate the functionality of your automated process.

6. **Contribution Submission:**
   - Follow the standard contribution process to submit your changes.

Thank you for contributing to our open-source project! Your efforts in automating processes will benefit the entire community.
